## Abstract
Under-a-tack is an application that displays various posters that a user can purchase using data fetched from our API. If a user clicks on a specific poster, the user is taken to the detail page of that specific poster which will show its title, artist, poster genre, and price. The user clicks add to cart button and can add this specific poster to the cart for purchase. The cart page will calculate the total based on the quantity of posters and includes shipping and tax. The user also can favorite a poster by clicking on the heart button of the poster. The poster would be saved to the favorites page.
